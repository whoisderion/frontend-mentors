### What I learned

This was my first time using VIM motions! It felt like forgetting how to type on command but by the end of this challenge I became very comfortable with the basic motions and plan on continuing my dive into mouseless development.

### Continued development

Developing a better intuition for creating components for simple UI components like this will by my goal for the next few challenges before I begin incorperating vanilla JS. After having worked on a few larger projects using tools like React and Prisma, I feel like I have a better idea of my weak spots. With this knowledge I now plan on working on the fundementals by improving my typing habits, becoming more comfortable and learning more about using text editors efficiently, learning Vim, improving my bash and linux skills, and relearning the fundementals of Javascript and Python. 

My stretch goals are to learn SQL, develop and app without an ORM, and improve my typing speed to 80 wpm.
